[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gdg-x/boomerang.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/gdg-x/boomerang) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/gdg-x/boomerang](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/gdg-x/boomerang?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Boomerang is a template for a dynamic material design GDG chapter web site that can be deployed with very little
work necessary! It pulls data from [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/), [GDG-X Hub](https://github.com/gdg-x/hub)
and [Google+ API](https://developers.google.com/+/api/) using [Angular](https://angular.io) and [Angular-Material](https://material.angular.io).


Configuration
---------------
Update src/environents/environent.ts with values appropriate for your group:

* **chapter**: The name of your GDG
* **meetup**: The name of your GDG as it shows up in your MeetUp url
* **googlePlus**: The ID of the Google+ page for your GDG; for example, if your page URL is https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/104918449869513449879/, then the ID is '104918449869513449879'.
* **googleApi**: The API key for your project, available from the [Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis)
  * Create a new project
  * Go to Credentials.
  * Click `Create credentials` -> `API Key` -> `Browser Key`
  * Click Create.
* **twitter**, **facebook**, **youtube**: Update these with your chapter's social network handles. Setting them to `null` will hide the icon.
* Create your Google Analytics account and modify the Google Analytics tracking code in **src/index.html**.

###### There are development and production environent variables, adjust them appropriatley!

Additional Optional Config
---------------
* **sponsors**: An array of sponsors that get shown in About, add new objects with the `name`, `url`, and `img` attributes
* **activities**: Disable or enable any type of event you host with boolean values.

To customize the theme of your site update src/styles/theme.scss and modify the arguments of `mat-palette()` in `$primary`
and `$accent` based on the material color pallete found [here](https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html#color-color-palette).

Building
---------------
Here you will install dependencies and tooling, test/run and build!
You must have Node.js installed to use the build tools. Download it [here](http://nodejs.org/download/).
Also this project uses the [Angular CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/cli). Install it by running `npm install -g @angular/cli`
From the boomerang2 directory, run the following:

* `npm install`
* `ng build`

Testing locally
---------------
To run and tinker with the app locally just run the commang

* `ng serve`

Deployment
---------------
Deploy on your web server of choice (Apache, Nginx, etc).
If you need a web server, Google App Engine's free tier should be more than sufficient for your chapter's needs.
